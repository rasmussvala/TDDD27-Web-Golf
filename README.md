# TDDD27: Web Multiplayer Game

## Description

Welcome to our project for the course [TDDD27 Advanced Web Programming](https://studieinfo.liu.se/kurs/TDDD27/vt-2024) at Link√∂ping University 2024. We have created a web-based multiplayer golf platform where players can compete against each other in real-time. The golf game is based on a previous project in the course [TNM085 Modelling Project](https://studieinfo.liu.se/kurs/TNM085/vt-2023), which deals with physics simulation through Euler approximation (link to GitHub repo: [Grantallkotten/Modelling-and-animation](https://github.com/Grantallkotten/Modeling-and-animation)). Beyond gameplay, players can interact via chat during sessions, access personal statistics, and compete for the top spot on the leaderboard.

## Technologies and Frameworks

We use the following technologies and frameworks:

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: For storing player data, game statistics, and other relevant information.
- **Three.js**: For creating the game.
- **Anime.js**: For simple UI related animations.

## Main Features

- User accounts
- User statistics
- Lobby codes to join games
- Game chat
- Real-time gameplay

## Run it on your local machine

To be able to run the code on your own machine, you need to take the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://gitlab.liu.se/rassv453/tddd27-aweb.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a **.env** file in the root of the project directory and add your Firebase API Key (It can be found at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/tddd27-aweb/settings/general/web:MDM3MjZlN2MtMmEyYy00MTY4LThhODYtOGRkNzEyZTg5ZWZk), but you need access). Then add the following line in your **.env** `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. **Run the Development Server**: `npm start`
